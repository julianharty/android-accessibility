A working home for experiments with Android Accessibility apps

Android Accessibility has yet to become mainstream or commonplace for Andrid apps. There are several challenges in trying to implement Accessible Android apps, including:
* major differences between 2.x and 4.x versions of Android in terms of support for Accessibility, etc. 2.x devices are still shipping and very popular however they lack Explore-By-Touch or other improvements in Accessibility support available in Android 4.x
* some significant languages are not available for the underlying TTS engines.

This repository is one place I'll experiment publicly with apps related to Accessibility and TTS.
